				in-order to move on to the next level. Inspired by the real-life party game Twister. Where players can
				get tripped-up on each other's fingers.

				Due to a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)" style="display: inline; margin: 0;"
					>hardware limitation</a
				>
				with how digital keyboards read input this game won't work on most modern keyboards due to the gameplay
				requiring multiple keystrokes (unless you have a really expensive one like the one we used to demo the
				game at ggj 2020).

			<h1>Warzone: Flashpoint</h1>
			<h4>Summary:</h4>
			<p>
				A Real-Time Strategy game aimed at reviving the virtually dead genre that had been very popular in the
				late ’90s through early 2000s. This project was greatly inspired by Command and Conquer. In my role as a
				junior gameplay programmer, I created several gameplay features and optimizations. Of which I made the
				units information screen, the upgrades system, and had started work on a garrison system. In late April
				we decided that it was necessary to adopt and switch over to Unity's new Data-Oriented Technology Stack,
				or DOTS. The project was officially put on hiatus in early October 2019.

				game center. After the game jam, I have made some minor modifications to polish the game a bit more.

			<h1>Granopacalypse (name wip):</h1>
			<h4>Summary:</h4>
			<p>
				First Person Zombie Survival - City Builder hybrid. This project is my dream game, almost any idea I
				have, has a place in this project. While the chances of this project coming to fruition are virtually
				impossible, I allow myself to dream through the lenses of this project. This can be summarized as the
				hellspawn of “Unturned” and “They Are Billions”. I occasionally go back to this project to work on
				features of it while I’m between work. Recently I started migrating the project over to the Universal
				Rendering Pipeline or UWP and started a rewrite of many systems.
