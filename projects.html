			<h1>2 fix 2 furious:</h1>
			<h4>Summary:</h4>
			<p>
				A local multiplayer puzzle game where you have to press certain keys on a keyboard in succession
				in-order to move on to the next level. Inspired by the real-life party game Twister. Where players can
				get tripped-up on each other's fingers.

				This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2020 in the NYU Game Center. Our team won the award:

			<p>
				Due to a
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_(key)" style="display: inline; margin: 0;"
					>hardware limitation</a
				>
				with how digital keyboards read input this game won't work on most modern keyboards due to the gameplay
				requiring multiple keystrokes (unless you have a really expensive one like the one we used to demo the
				game at ggj 2020).
